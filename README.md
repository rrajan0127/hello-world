What I would like to accomplish in Web Design.

I do not have any experience in web design. I was working as a software test engineer. So I would like to learn the key concepts in designing a good web site. Moreover, I would like to learn different design methods and layout like placing contents and its order, different types of medias like text, audio, video and images so that I will be able to create a standard user friendly web site that should be accessble by people with disabilities.
